# Charlie Monterroso
- I'm learning how to speak spanish which I find pretty neat as I can notice my improvements each week.
- I like setting time trials in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for my brothers to beat when they visit.
- I occasionally go rock climbing.

## Technical Background
I have experience programming in mostly Python and a bit in C. Aside from the projects required for my computing courses, I have also made simple temperature conversion calculators in Python as well as automating the scheduling of appointments for my mom's clients.
